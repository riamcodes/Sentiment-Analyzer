/* 
 * Implement the functions defined in DSString.h. You may add more functions as needed
 * for the project. 
 *
 * Note that c-strings use `\0` as a terminator symbol
 * but your class should store its length in a member variable. Do not use c-string functions 
 * from <string.h> or <cstring> other than for conversion from a c-string.
